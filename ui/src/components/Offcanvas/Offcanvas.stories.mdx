# Offcanvas
The select is a useful control for picking an option from a long list of items.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default"
    args={{
      trigger: (<Button variant="color" color="blue">Open canvas</Button>),
      children: ([
        <OffcanvasHeader>Canvas</OffcanvasHeader>,
        <OffcanvasContent>
          <p>This is a dialog content box. Place anything you want in here.</p>
        </OffcanvasContent>
      ])
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## No modal
If you want users to be able to interact with other elements while te dialog is open then you can disabled the modal behavior with `disableModal`.

This will render no backdrop and allow you to scroll the page content.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="None-modal dialog"
    args={{
      disableModal: true,
      trigger: (<Button variant="color" color="blue">Open dialog</Button>),
      children: ([
        <OffcanvasHeader>Dialog</OffcanvasHeader>,
        <OffcanvasContent>
          <p>This is a dialog content box. Place anything you want in here.</p>
        </OffcanvasContent>
      ])
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Description
The `DialogDescription` component provides a component that will be announced when the dialog is opened for screenreaders. This component can be hidden with the `visuallyHidden` property. It is strongly recommneded to always have a `DialgDescription` component in your dialog.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Visually hidden description"
    args={{
      trigger: (<Button variant="color" color="blue">Open dialog</Button>),
      children: ([
        <OffcanvasHeader>Dialog</OffcanvasHeader>,
        <OffcanvasContent>
          <p>This is a dialog content box. Place anything you want in here.</p>
        </OffcanvasContent>
      ])
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="No description"
    args={{
      trigger: (<Button variant="color" color="blue">Open dialog</Button>),
      children: ([
        <OffcanvasHeader>Dialog</OffcanvasHeader>,
        <OffcanvasContent>
          <p>This is a dialog content box. Place anything you want in here.</p>
        </OffcanvasContent>
      ])
    }}

    {Template.bind({})}
