# Offcanvas
The Offcanvas component is similar to the Dialog component in its behavior and API.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Offcanvas">
    {() => {
      const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
      return (
        <>
          <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open canvas</Button>
          <Offcanvas open={open} setOpen={setOpen}>
            <OffcanvasHeader action={<CloseButton setOpen={setOpen} />}>Offcanvas example</OffcanvasHeader>
            <OffcanvasBody>
              <p>
                Are you sure you want to deactivate your account? All of your data
                will be permanently removed. This action cannot be undone.
              </p>
            </OffcanvasBody>
          </Offcanvas>
        </>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Position
You can cahnge the position of the canvas with the `position` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="End canvas">
    {() => {
      const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
      return (
        <>
          <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open canvas right</Button>
          <Offcanvas open={open} setOpen={setOpen} position="end">
            <OffcanvasHeader action={<CloseButton setOpen={setOpen} />}>Offcanvas example</OffcanvasHeader>
            <OffcanvasBody>
              <p>
                Are you sure you want to deactivate your account? All of your data
                will be permanently removed. This action cannot be undone.
              </p>
            </OffcanvasBody>
          </Offcanvas>
        </>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Disable backdrop
If you don't want a backdrop to be rendered, that's possible too.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Backdropless canvas">
    {() => {
      const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
      return (
        <>
          <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open canvas without Backdrop</Button>
          <Offcanvas open={open} setOpen={setOpen} disableBackdrop>
            <OffcanvasHeader action={<CloseButton setOpen={setOpen} />}>Offcanvas example</OffcanvasHeader>
            <OffcanvasBody>
              <p>
                Are you sure you want to deactivate your account? All of your data
                will be permanently removed. This action cannot be undone.
              </p>
            </OffcanvasBody>
          </Offcanvas>
        </>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
